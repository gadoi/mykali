pip install -U --user shodan
shodan
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY

Troubleshooting
shodan: command not found

If the installation succeeded without errors but you're unable to run the command then try closing and re-opening the terminal window.
pip: command not found

This means that you either don't have Python properly installed or that you're running an older version which doesn't include pip. Try using one of these alternate commands to install the Shodan CLI:

$ easy_install -U --user shodan

Or if your system only has the pip3 tool:

$ pip3 install -U --user shodan
